# unitc
Dimensional analysis for the C programming language. Lets programmers annotate C source code with units such as meters or feet, and have them automatically checked.

This is a work in progress. Not much is working yet.

Build: `stack build`

Example invocation: `stack exec unitc doc/examples/bad1.c`
